      Hi everyone. This is just going to be a short blog journey of me learning
      React (via Udemy) through the Summer Holidays and how I understand some of
      the tougher concepts. As always, credit to: https://markdowntohtml.com/
      for the conversion of MD to HTML.

      <em><u>Before React</u></em
      >:
    </h3>
    <p>Every web-page simply ran on:<br /></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Javascript, for interactivity</li>
      <li>HTML, to display text and simple elements.</li>
      <li>CSS, to stylise text and elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These were used to display and change the <em>DOM</em>.<br />
      However, each browser (e.g Chrome, IE, Firefox…) had different ways to run
      Javascript.<br />
      This problem was solved by <em>JQuery</em>, which used its own API to make
      sure Javascript code can run on every browser with no changes required.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Though such applications became more and more complex: for example,
      FaceBook.<br />
      We quickly changed to <em>Single-Page Applications</em>, where we now
      focus a lot more on the Javascript of an application - rather than
      refreshing/loading all the HTML/CSS/Javascript each time a user clicks on
      something.<br />
      Therefore the Javascript code itself is now in charge of updating the
      HTML/CSS.<br />
    </p>
    <h3 id="-u-react-concepts-u-br-">

    <p>
      <u>“Don’t touch the DOM, I’ll do it”</u><br />
      <em>Imperative</em>: manipulating the DOM directly via DOM API (e.g
      library: element.innerHTML)<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Document Object Model</em>: The way a website displays things,
        manipulated by Javascript and is seen as a tree-representation of a
        page. <br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>Declarative</em>: “DOM manipulation is a bottleneck: change/add
      elements, reflow: move and recalculate layout of page.”<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      React instead only requires the blueprints (i.e. “state”) of how the page
      should look like - and automatically manipulates the DOM for us in the
      best way possible.<br />
      To summarise:
      <em
        >[ Based on our state -&gt; “React” and adjust/display our Page for us
        ]</em
      ><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>“Build websites like lego blocks”</u><br />
      React is based on Reusable components (for example: Navbar) and has
      components within components.<br />
      State: any data that describes our app (for example: isLoggedIn: True).<br />
      Components are built based on that data simply as Javascript functions
      (receive Props, returns HTML inside JS).<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>“Unidirectional data flow”</u><br />
      React is a JS library to increase interactivity in our apps.<br />
      In React, we have state - which is an object that describes our app
      through data.<br />
      We also have components that return HTML (JSX) inside our JS code.<br />
      <em>JSX</em>: A HTML like syntax that is used inside Javascript code.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A component and state with JSX is combined in React to create a VirtualDOM
      (tree like object).<br />
      One way data flow is occurring because the VirtualDOM only changes when
      our state changes. Data can never move up on React. Such restriction can
      allow easier debugging of code (e.g. sign up button bugging - look at
      where data exists/flows through).<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>UI, The rest is up to you</u><br />
      AngularJS was a framework (like a Kitchen: knife, pan, stove, etc.), very
      opinionated.<br />
      React only works with the view (User Interface), anything else - use other
      modules yourself (like a Stove to cook on, your knife, spoon, etc. is your
      choice).<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>React Library: Components of a blueprint to make changes.<br /></li>
      <li>React DOM: Interacts with DOM and makes changes.<br /></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      React only needs the blueprint on how to change components. Therefore
      React can be used in any technology stack, for example: React Native.<br />
    </p>
    <h3 id="-important-areas-to-focus-on-br-">
      <em>Important areas to focus on</em>:<br />
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Decide on Components</li>
      <li>Decide the State and where it lives</li>
      <li>What changes when state changes</li>
    </ul>
