# Summary of Week02 Lectures

## Major three types of Normatic Ethics:

### Utilitarianism/Consequentialism

Ethics and moral judgement is achieved through the measurement (observation) and maximisation of utility (happiness over sadness) based on imperical evidence.

### Kantian Ethics

Ethics and moral judgement come within through the exploration of categorical imperative (universality of certain laws) and does not rely on any imperical data.

### Virtue Ethics

Ethics and moral judgement are derived through one's virtues and emotions through the comparison of a more virtuous individual.

#### Exploring Deontology:

Util. <---> Deontology.

Rule-based Util (within the middle).

Deontology strongly prohibits certain classes of actions (that fails categorical imperative test).

Negative duty (for example: Don't murder, your duty is to NOT murder -> which is a perfect duty).
(Passes imperative test): Permissable (for example: assisting the poor, upto you how much and when -> which is an imperfect duty).
NOT empirical, more axiomatic (conceptual) rather than observation, Kant analysis concepts/definitions and extrapolates from such concepts.

Deontologist (rule-based theory):

- Kant is worried about excuses, and justifications of the wrong.
- Contemporary deontologist are worried about horrible actions being justified.

Empirical = a posteriori (we can't do anything until post observation).
Conceptual = a priori (don't need to observe anything, it is prior observation).

Preliminary works:

- (Relevant) _**Ground work** (the beginning) to metaphysics of morals_, written in 1785. Based on the human capacity for free agency or autonomy (Auto - self, Nomis - law: give the law to ourselves), the human being is different from instinct-driven animals. Animals cannot make deep considerations of the future (lack long-term planning). Human beings can direct their lives according to reason. Capacity of autonomy Kant says is very important, humans have a duty (thinking of their actions and consequences) to animals but an animal cannot have a duty to humans. Kant argues that autonomy gives us dignity - that we can live our lives in the "long-term" and should only determined by ourselves - we do not need a third-party (any individual/government) to decide for us. Thus implies that humans are Ends (goal/outcome) in Themselves (you create your own end/future through rational planning _for_ ourselves).
  1. **Maxim: general rule.** (Example: give to the poor, do not steal, muder etc.) Could I desire this to be a universal law? For example: give to the poor, not self contradicting because no one WANTS to be poor.
     Borrowing money, but not giving back but now society will never trust anyone with their money. **Maxim: it's okay to borrow money, but not give back**.
  2. There would be times there would be exceptions to these universal rules for example: lying to save a life, this exemption case is now a universal case that will pass, allowing for exceptions. However now Deontology is moving towards the middle, where rule utilitarianism is near (similar to how introducing rules to Utilitarianism moves towards rule Util.).
- _Critique of practical reasoning_, written in 1788.

Not _much_ impact:

- _Metaphysics of Morals_, written in 1797.

#### Exploring Virtue Theory:

Aristotle Virtue Theory:

- Virtue Theory is not based on decision-making.
- Majority of history is about the character/judgement of others and one's self.
- Aristotle wanted to create a well-rounded theory behind virtues, rather than the virtue of aggression and domination (single virtues) from Greek history. Rather wanting to produce a character in rationality, a character that is more well-rounded (multiple virtues).

Contemporary Virtue Theory:

- Utilitarianism and Kantian ethics seems inhumane, for example: Harry S. Truman using utilitarianism to justify the bombing of Japan.
- General motivation: there is too much left (that make us human) out from the two theories, for example utilitarianism ruling out human intimate relationships when calculating utility (intimacy makes us human). The thought that a moral theory would throw out what a human is repulsive, essentially asking us to become in-human. There's no space for love, building relationship etc.
- Kant's theory is shown as very narrowly focused (universal laws, things you must NOT do).
- Other two theories are too technical and not based on human emotions/experience, such as love.

Back to Aristotle Virtue Theory...

- Often Virtue Ethicists are critical of utilitarianism and deontologists.
- Often is associated on _how_ we live our lives, and focuses on _becoming_ virtuous.
- Aristotle: You will never be able to generate a system of rules that will _always_ be correct in every situation because moral problems are multidimensional.

  1. However you _can_ grow and _improve_ yourself into a better human being that is more sensitive to moral dimensions of life (similar to how 10,000 hours is seen as an expert).

  2. Essentially, since the more you think, practice and engage about moral theory/virtue, you will become more sensitive to the moral dimensions of life.

  3. Develop a habit: surround a man with other virtuous men, for example: practising medicine around experts, learning about the theory behind driving but never stepping inside a vehicle.

- Agent centered, but how does this relate to others? Others can benefit from one's virtuous activity, for example: mutual benefits from one's profession - especially in IT.
- Virtues are _character traits_, for example: courage, patience, justice, fairness etc.
- However Aristotle sees one character traits above others: prudence.

  1. Phronesis (balancing the virtues), for example: Courage might get in the way of temperance. Virtues requires wisdom and regulation so they do not conflict and undermine one another.

  2. Prudence is often known as practical wisdom.
  3. We accept virtues have the capacity of clashing. Prudence is the capacity to see on how to balance one's virtues, for example: giving a friend money when they are a drug addict.
  4. Prudencia takes wisdom (_insight_) to solve certain moral problems.
