      mortal.

    <p>
      Everything before &quot;therefore&quot; are <strong>claims</strong>.
      Everything after &quot;therefore&quot; is a <strong>conclusion</strong>.

    <p>
      An ethical argument, is an argument in which the conclusion is a
      <strong>moral judgement/statement</strong>. A
      <strong>moral judgement</strong> is for example, &quot;burning kittens is
      wrong&quot;.

    <h3 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Utilitarianism</strong> relies on making moral claims and
        ethical justifications based on imperical data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kantian ethics</strong>, rely on pure axioms and does not rely
        on imperical data, i.e. pure computation, no external data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Virtue ethics</strong> is similar to data sets and machine
        learning
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Utilitarianism is a variety of consequentialism: which is a theory of
      <strong>normative</strong> (as opposed to meta) ethics.
      <strong>Consequentialism</strong> is a theory of ethics that focuses on
      cause, e.g. causing suffering <em>is</em> the wrong thing. Our actions do
      not have any intrinstic or inherent - moral values are the consequences of
      our actions that maximises happiness, minimise suffering. Utilitarianism
      schema are meant to apply universally all the time and is based on
      <strong>naturalism</strong> (alongside natural Sciences) that converts the
      bad and good to &quot;measurable&quot; suffering and happiness
      respectively. Cannot assign discrete values for borderline cases, but for
      vast majority of cases - we do know according to utilitarianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real explainations are given by the natural sciences, need to be
      falsifiable based on evidence (from the scientific method). Hence
      utilitarianism allows ethical claims to be measurable from observing
      happiness and suffering. Normative moral claims give instructions. For
      example, 10 commandments are moral instructions.

      <em>Utilitarianism</em>: reduces interpersonal and moral obligations to
      mere calculations of utility. Would we ever have strong civilisations?
      Bias to certain groups has been the cause of terrible things. However
      arguably - it has also been the very thing that has allowed our species to
      flourish if it had not shown preferential bias. Thus utilitariniasm:
      Suppose three-people bottom rail, one-people (dearest friend) on top rail.
      Pull the level and hit the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runaway trolley is a train that is moving autonomously, however you
      can move it. All self-driving cars are runaway rail carts with navigation
      protocols based on your choices on whether the switch should be pulled.
      Though, you are <em>one</em> of the people on &quot;track&quot; because
      you are <em>on</em> the vehicle. What if it was programmed by a
      utilitarianism? I.e. kills <em>you</em> if it would possibly kill more
      than two people. Hence, what protocols should be in place when programming
      such autonomous vehicles?
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans = unpredictable. Vehicles = predictable. For a modern example:
      100,000 &quot;runaway trolleys&quot; - difficult to predict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern day, due to the idea of consequentialism - major goal is to reduce
      suffering.

    <p>Util. &lt;---&gt; Deontology.</p>
    <p>Rule-based Util (within the middle).</p>
    <p>
      Deontology strongly prohibits certain classes of actions (that fails
      categorical imperative test).
    </p>
    <p>
      Negative duty (for example: Don&#39;t murder, your duty is to NOT murder
      -&gt; which is a perfect duty). (Passes imperative test): Permissable (for
      example: assisting the poor, upto you how much and when -&gt; which is an
      imperfect duty). NOT empirical, more axiomatic (conceptual) rather than
      observation, Kant analysis concepts/definitions and extrapolates from such
      concepts.
    </p>
    <p>Deontologist (rule-based theory):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kant is worried about excuses, and justifications of the wrong.</li>
      <li>
        Contemporary deontologist are worried about horrible actions being
        justified.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Empirical = a posteriori (we can&#39;t do anything until post
      observation). Conceptual = a priori (don&#39;t need to observe anything,
      it is prior observation).
    </p>
    <p>Preliminary works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (Relevant)
        <em
          ><strong>Ground work</strong> (the beginning) to metaphysics of
          morals</em
        >, written in 1785. Based on the human capacity for free agency or
        autonomy (Auto - self, Nomis - law: give the law to ourselves), the
        human being is different from instinct-driven animals. Animals cannot
        make deep considerations of the future (lack long-term planning). Human
        beings can direct their lives according to reason. Capacity of autonomy
        Kant says is very important, humans have a duty (thinking of their
        actions and consequences) to animals but an animal cannot have a duty to
        humans. Kant argues that autonomy gives us dignity - that we can live
        our lives in the &quot;long-term&quot; and should only determined by
        ourselves - we do not need a third-party (any individual/government) to
        decide for us. Thus implies that humans are Ends (goal/outcome) in
        Themselves (you create your own end/future through rational planning
        <em>for</em> ourselves).
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Maxim: general rule.</strong> (Example: give to the poor, do
            not steal, muder etc.) Could I desire this to be a universal law?
            For example: give to the poor, not self contradicting because no one
            WANTS to be poor. Borrowing money, but not giving back but now
            society will never trust anyone with their money.
            <strong
              >Maxim: it&#39;s okay to borrow money, but not give back</strong
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            There would be times there would be exceptions to these universal
            rules for example: lying to save a life, this exemption case is now
            a universal case that will pass, allowing for exceptions. However
            now Deontology is moving towards the middle, where rule
            utilitarianism is near (similar to how introducing rules to
            Utilitarianism moves towards rule Util.).

    <h4 id="exploring-virtue-theory-">Exploring Virtue Theory:</h4>
    <p>Aristotle Virtue Theory:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Virtue Theory is not based on decision-making.</li>
      <li>
        Majority of history is about the character/judgement of others and
        one&#39;s self.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aristotle wanted to create a well-rounded theory behind virtues, rather
        than the virtue of aggression and domination (single virtues) from Greek
        history. Rather wanting to produce a character in rationality, a
        character that is more well-rounded (multiple virtues).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Contemporary Virtue Theory:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Utilitarianism and Kantian ethics seems inhumane, for example: Harry S.
        Truman using utilitarianism to justify the bombing of Japan.
      </li>
      <li>
        General motivation: there is too much left (that make us human) out from
        the two theories, for example utilitarianism ruling out human intimate
        relationships when calculating utility (intimacy makes us human). The
        thought that a moral theory would throw out what a human is repulsive,
        essentially asking us to become in-human. There&#39;s no space for love,
        building relationship etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kant&#39;s theory is shown as very narrowly focused (universal laws,
        things you must NOT do).
      </li>
      <li>
        Other two theories are too technical and not based on human
        emotions/experience, such as love.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Back to Aristotle Virtue Theory...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Often Virtue Ethicists are critical of utilitarianism and deontologists.
      </li>
      <li>
        Often is associated on <em>how</em> we live our lives, and focuses on
        <em>becoming</em> virtuous.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Aristotle: You will never be able to generate a system of rules that
          will <em>always</em> be correct in every situation because moral
          problems are multidimensional.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              However you <em>can</em> grow and <em>improve</em> yourself into a
              better human being that is more sensitive to moral dimensions of
              life (similar to how 10,000 hours is seen as an expert).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Essentially, since the more you think, practice and engage about
              moral theory/virtue, you will become more sensitive to the moral
              dimensions of life.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Develop a habit: surround a man with other virtuous men, for
              example: practising medicine around experts, learning about the
              theory behind driving but never stepping inside a vehicle.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Agent centered, but how does this relate to others? Others can benefit
          from one&#39;s virtuous activity, for example: mutual benefits from
          one&#39;s profession - especially in Information Technology (IT).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Virtues are <em>character traits</em>, for example: courage, patience,
        justice, fairness etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          However Aristotle sees one character traits above others: prudence.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Phronesis (balancing the virtues), for example: Courage might get
              in the way of temperance. Virtues requires wisdom and regulation
              so they do not conflict and undermine one another.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Prudence is often known as practical wisdom.</p></li>
          <li>
            We accept virtues have the capacity of clashing. Prudence is the
            capacity to see on how to balance one&#39;s virtues, for example:
            giving a friend money when they are a drug addict.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prudencia takes wisdom (<em>insight</em>) to solve certain moral
            problems.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Overall goal:</strong> Eudaimonia (good | spirt), be
          good-spirited and to do well, flourish.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Often translated to <em>flourishing</em>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For example: physically well, exercising their mind to be
              intelligent, thoughtful, accumalated enough things needed, have
              enough skill in their career, good relationship etc. Essentially
              doing well overall (flourishing across multidimensions).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Artistotle has a functional concept of good (moral conception: saints,
      agents). However Artistotle believes that a thing is good if it serves its
      purpose <em>well</em>, for example: a knife is sharp and cuts well, a good
      race horse is that one that is fast. However a function of a human being
      is complicated, but is based on rationality and well-being but there is
      more to that. For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        <span class="hljs-number">1</span>. Good doctor: Virtues <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> a doctor.
        <span class="hljs-number">2</span>. Good soldier: Virtues <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> a soldier.
        <span class="hljs-number">3</span>. Good journalist: Virtues <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> a journalist.
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Virtues are virtuous because they help us function. Emotions = Non
      Rational, however Aristotle seems to think that that our emotions have
      registered/seen something important, i.e. alert us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtues are caught between vices. For example, overly scared (cowardly),
      not scared enough (fool). Courage lies inside in the middle, i.e the
      <em>golden mean</em>. Either side leads to a failure to process this
      event. Aristotle: Virtues --&gt; Rationality of Passion --&gt; Golden
      Mean: between excess and deficiency.
