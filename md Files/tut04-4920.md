# Summary of Week04 Lecture

All credit goes to UNSW COMP4920's notes, I do not own a part of these notes - they have been inspired from my Tutor's work: Philip Quadrio.

### Ethics Washing

Ethics washing refers to specific critique, differing for Munn's central criticism.
For example, airline companies promoting a green image despite being in a polluting industry.

### MUNN: AI Ethics has a capacity to harm

- Harm is more than physical harm - psychology, emotional, property.
- Can exacerbate inequality - racial or demographic profiling, impacting on minorities and worst off.
- Racialised assumptions - in security, in screening (jobs) ...
- Undermines Democratic values - social media disinformation during electoral cycle
- Human Rights and dignity - rights to privacy
- AI Ethics _social space_ that is already stratified (economic, racial and gendered stratification)

For example: Parallels to Townhall's old CCTV scripting to find middle-eastern men, young men in hoodies etc.
Social media - impacting US Federal elections, Russia causing unrest via social media for both the left and right.
Pitch products to consumer habits lead to lack of privacy.

### MUNN: Turn to AI ethics ineffective

- AI Ethics: in Munn's view - is about _regulation_ through codes and principles.
- Codes and Principles seem to _neglect_ the political, social and cultural dimensions bound up with AI in general.
- WHile we fail to address the broader political, social and cultural dimensions it will continue to harm.
- Codes work through principles, practices are shaped by politics, economics and culture.
- So, **Gap between Principles and Practice** as Practice is shaped by politics, economics and culture. However
  priciples simply sit somewhere.

AI production is lead from deeper problems inside society and is simply layered ontop of these deeper issues inside society.
Thus, source of the "harm" will remain.

### MUNN: Meaningless Principles

- Meaningless, isolated and toothless
- Highly abstract and ambigious principles which _almost become incoherent_ for example: moral philosophy = the 'good' = about beneficence = do 'good'(?).
- They promise to be action guiding but are ultimately too abstract to guide practical actions.
- They provide few specific recommendations.
- Concepts such as Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice and Explicability are contested, that is; the principles are expressed
  through concepts that can be interpreted differently, contesting meaning.
- There can be conflicts and contradictions between them sometimes respecting autonomy contradicts other principles (doing good - beneficence).
- They can be defined to suit a corporate agenda that might not be good for society/humanity.
- Fail to address political tension.

For example: these concepts can have differing perspectives/definitions based on who ask. Principles can also contradict with each other - for example:
an addicted drug-user in rehab. Furthermore, might cater to a corporate agenda that may ultimately be negative to society.
case-example: not using plastics from airline companies but still uses fuel... shapes and twists principles.

### MUNN: Isolated Principles

- "The principles are isolated."
- AI Ethics discretely parceled up and tucked away as a niche topic at end of a course of study, not integrated into the wider program of study.
- Development of tech occurs in a social and political context: it is social, cultural and political and is influence by society, culture and political
  practices as well as existing tech practices.
- Education focus is on professionalism and professional ethics and ignores social and political issues.
- The toxic culture (e.g. Brogrammers) is bound up with broader cultural, social and political issues.
- **Isolated** from social and political background leads to _'tweaking'_ as a remedy (but that is narrow),
- Organisational culture and commerical culture leads to a focus on 'ethics' and ineffectual solutions.
- Failure to build ethical AI is an organisational failure.

Brogrammer: hypermasculine programmer, for example: midnight, shirtless, sunglasses etc.
This is bound by broader societal, political and cultural issues, stems from 'Bro' which is created from the masculine culture in society.
Hence this 'AI problem' stems from a deeper issue.
